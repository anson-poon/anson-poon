## üê∞ Introduction

Hello!üëã I'm Anson, a Software Developer. I transitioned from a design background to software development a while ago because I found my passion in solving real-world engineering challenges through coding and automation, which inspired me to build software that yields meaningful and lasting impact. 

In my spare time, I like to work on cars and watch films. I am also passionate about architecture, interior design, and coffee.
